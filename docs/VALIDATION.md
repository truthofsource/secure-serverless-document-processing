# Validation evidence

**Terms used here:** DNS turns a service name into the network address used to reach it.

## Executed locally

| Check | Recorded result |
| --- | --- |
| Actual extracted TypeScript rules | 6 tests passed |
| Python reference/renderer | 13 tests passed |
| Executed demonstration | 8 checks passed |
| Terraform schema and mock plans | Validate passed; 2 tests using simulated cloud responses passed; no apply |
| Browser | Desktop and 390-pixel mobile, tabs/rerun, origin/asset denials passed |
| Workflow syntax | actionlint 1.7.12 passed; no hosted workflow dispatched |
| Source secret scan | Trivy 0.75.0: zero findings in this prepared input |

The six actual source tests establish the provider-result mapping. The Python demo replays fictional verdicts; it does not run a malware engine or prove actual Defender delivery. Its eight checks include clean, pending, malicious-verdict and error-verdict cases.

The [machine record](validation-results.json) includes date, commands, counts and source hashes. Screenshots come from the working local code. They are not hand-edited success states or Azure Portal captures.

## Reproduce

```bash
npm run test:source
python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -B -m lab demo
```

## Evidence boundaries

- Actual implementation source/tests are distinct from a compact public renderer or event adapter.
- Synthetic inputs preserve privacy; they do not establish real provider output quality, identity or employee findings.
- Mock plans do not prove deployed IAM, DNS, queue delivery, SQL adapter or application hosting.
- No Azure service start, actual employee operation, live provider request or paid image call occurred for this preparation.
- [Nonproduction screenshot capture](SCREENSHOT-PLAN.md) remains optional follow-up. Existing accepted operational history is not relabeled as a fresh cloud test.
